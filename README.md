This is a repository that creates an Alexa skill created for the use of PSEG and PSEG employees 
during my summer internship with PSEG. This was written in javascript to help people learn facts 
about the company and safety within the company. The only files that were written by me are the 
three files directly in the master branch that begin with the name safety information. The rest 
of the files were taken from the Alexa Cookbook and were only used for reference on how to work 
with and create Alexa Skills.
