This is a repository that creates an Alexa skill created for the use of PSEG and PSEG employees. 
This was written in javascript to help people learn facts about the company and safety within the
company. The only files that were written by me are the three files directly in the master branch.
The rest of the files were taken from the Alexa Cookbook and were only used for reference on how to
work with and create Alexa Skills.
